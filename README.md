# Pong

I wanted to do some simple graphics programming in Odin to experiment with both. So I've decided to implement Pong.
Having the superpowers of a modern programming languages and unlimited memory and CPU makes me appreciate the first version of Pong even more.

## Multiplayer

Yep, supports 2 players. Both using the same keyboard. Left paddle is controlled with W and S; right paddle is controlled with UP and DOWN keys.

## How to run

Well, you need Odin and SDL2 installed.
Then you run `odin run src` from the root of the repo.
Yes, I should provide at least a shell script, better output name and directory. Someday...
